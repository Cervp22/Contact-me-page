      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>
        To who it may concern. My name is Paul Cervnates. I work for a serve
        poour tech company. I've been coding for almost a year. My goal is to
        become a great full stack coder for my career. Some hobbies of mine are
        sports,photography,movies,video games, and PC building. Some other
        things I like to do is be creative and make whatever whats in my head a
        reality. My current positon at my job is a lead installer for
        development projects with self serve. Seeing the projects progress is
        what I like seeing over time. The best apart is seeing a completed
        project from sketches to reality.
        <br />
        work makes me travel alot and I was given the chance to visit different
        countries like England, Colombia, Norway, and Ireland. There is alot of
        instate travel too. Domestically I've visited Washington, Georgia, South
        Carolina, Chicago, Florida, and more.
        <br />
        <br />
        The projects Ive done below are small but some that I did as I was
        starting my coding journey. The pokedex one is my favorite from all of
        them since it's about Pokemon.
