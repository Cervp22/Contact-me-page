This assignment is the start of a professional portfolio

This portfolio has content about myself Paul. Futrue projects that I will be doing. (keep in mind right now the projects that are displayed do not have a set page but will.) I plan on updating this page from time to time to improve it with with new way of coding that I learn.

The fom on the bottom does take you to a new page that thanks the users for submitting there information and a resonse will shortly come there way. There is also a hyperlink there to click to get you back to the main page.

navigation bar and footer do change colors to blue at a specific window size number. So do the color for the font/characters so that way its able to pop out.

Hope you enjoy!
